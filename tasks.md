## Implementation Details

### Task-Specific Models
1. **Object Detection**: YOLOv3-inspired architecture with:
   - Darknet backbone for feature extraction
   - Feature pyramid network for multi-scale detection
   - Specialized heads for object classification and bounding box regression
   - Video-specific processing for temporal information

2. **Semantic Segmentation**: U-Net architecture with:
   - Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections
   - Attention mechanisms for improving feature utilization
   - DeepLabV3+ variant for enhanced segmentation quality
   - Video-specific processing for temporal consistency

3. **Object Tracking**: Siamese network architecture with:
   - Feature extraction for target and search regions
   - Cross-correlation for measuring similarity
   - Target-specific activation mapping
   - Temporal processing for maintaining tracking over video sequences

### Loss Functions
1. **Compression Loss**: Rate-distortion optimization combining:
   - Distortion term (MSE, perceptual loss)
   - Rate term (entropy estimation)
   - Lagrangian multiplier for balancing rate and distortion

2. **Task-Aware Loss**: Multi-objective optimization with:
   - Task-specific loss components (detection, segmentation, tracking)
   - Temporal consistency loss
   - Weighted combination of compression and task performance

### Performance Metrics
1. **Compression Metrics**:
   - PSNR, SSIM for reconstruction quality
   - Bits-per-pixel (bpp) for bitrate
   - Compression ratio
   - BD-rate for comparative evaluation

2. **Task-Specific Metrics**:
   - Detection: mAP at various IoU thresholds
   - Segmentation: mIoU, Dice coefficient
   - Tracking: MOTA, IDF1, ID switches

## Next Steps
1. Create config files for different experimental setups
2. Implement visualization tools for qualitative analysis
3. Optimize training pipeline for faster iteration
4. Explore additional task models and compression techniques
5. Integrate with real-time streaming applications

## Project Summary
The VCM-ST-NPP (Spatio-Temporal Neural Preprocessing for Standard-Compatible Video Coding in Machine Vision Tasks) project integrates neural preprocessing with standard video codecs for optimized performance on computer vision tasks. 

### Architecture Overview
1. Raw video is processed by the ST-NPP module which extracts essential features
2. The QAL module adapts these features for compression by standard codecs
3. During training, a proxy codec simulates the effects of the real codec
4. For deployment, standard codecs (HEVC/VVC) receive the preprocessed frames
5. Task-specific networks (detection, segmentation, tracking) process decoded frames

### Key Features
- Compatibility with standard video codecs
- Optimization specifically for downstream vision tasks
- Support for multiple task types
- Comprehensive evaluation framework comparing to standard methods

All components are implemented and ready for use. The codebase provides a complete framework for training, evaluation, and benchmarking of the task-aware video compression system.
