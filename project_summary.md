# Task-Aware Video Preprocessing System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Task-Aware Video Preprocessing (TAVP) system is a novel end-to-end video preprocessing framework designed to optimize video compression for both bit rate efficiency and downstream AI task performance. The system preprocesses video frames to enhance task-relevant features before standard video compression, resulting in improved performance for vision tasks like object detection, segmentation, and tracking at equivalent bit rates.

## Key Innovations

1. **Task-Aware Feature Extraction**: By jointly training with downstream vision tasks, the system learns to preserve features critical for those tasks during compression.

2. **Codec-Agnostic Approach**: Works with standard video codecs (H.264, HEVC) without requiring modifications to the codec itself.

3. **Quantization Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment of feature representation based on codec quantization parameters to optimize the rate-distortion-task performance tradeoff.

4. **Temporal-Spatial Processing**: Leverages both spatial and temporal redundancies in video for efficient compression while maintaining task performance.
